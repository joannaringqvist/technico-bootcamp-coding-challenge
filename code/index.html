      <h2>What is pair programming?</h2>
      <p>
          Pair programming means that two persons write code together on one machine.

      <h2>How does it work?</h2>
      <p>
        The pair consists of a driver and an observer.
        The driver writes code while the observer, or navigator, reviews 
          each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently.
          The idea of this role division is to have two different perspectives on the code.

        Why is it good?
      </h2>
      <p>
        It is a very collaborative way of working and involves a lot of communication. While a pair of developers work on a task together, they do not only write code, they also plan and discuss their work. They clarify ideas on the way, discuss approaches and come to better solutions.
